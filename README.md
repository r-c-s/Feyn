## Feyn

A polygon-based 3D graphics engine in Java

## Motivation

Named after Richard Feynman for his quote:

*"What I cannot create, I do not understand; know how to solve every problem that has been solved."*

In other words, Feyn is an educational tool. It serves as a medium through which I learn not only about graphics and math, but also about virtually about every universal programming aspect, which has been proven to be easily transferable to other domains.

## Examples

The "Hello World" of computer graphics, the Utah Teapot, composed of 530 vertex-normal pairs and 1024 faces.

A little more complex one: a mini-Cooper with 44436 vertex-normal pairs and 79759 faces.
