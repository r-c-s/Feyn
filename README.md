## Feyn

A polygon-based real-time 3D graphics engine in Java

### Motivation

Named after Richard Feynman, the famous physicist, for his quote:

*"What I cannot create, I do not understand; know how to solve every problem that has been solved."*

In other words, Feyn is an educational tool. It proudly reinvents the wheel. It serves as a medium through which I learn not only about graphics and math, but also about virtually about every universal programming aspect, which has been proven to be easily transferable to other domains.

### Examples

The "Hello World" of computer graphics, the Utah Teapot, composed of 530 vertex-normal pairs and 1024 faces.
